## Book Recommender System ##
This project implements a book recommender system using Python and the pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn libraries. The system provides recommendations based on user ratings and book attributes.

## Prerequisites ##

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

1) Python (>=3.6)
2) pandas
3) numpy
4) scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Getting Started ##
Clone the repository:

https://github.com/arpita1412/bookRecommender.git

## Files Included ##
1. book_recommender_system.ipynb :

It includes processes like:

-> Loading and preprocessing book-related data.

-> Implementing a recommendation algorithm (e.g., collaborative filtering or content-based).

-> Generating book suggestions for users based on their preferences using a mechanism like cosine similarity, matrix factorization, or nearest neighbors.

-> Evaluating the system's performance using metrics like accuracy or MSE.

Finally outputs a matrix of cosine similarity scores between famous books. These scores indicate the similarity between pairs of books, which can be used to provide personalized book recommendations to users.
